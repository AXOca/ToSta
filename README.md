This is my repository for handy tools for Stand. 




## How it Works
This script, written in the ancient language of Batch, works like a Swiss Army knife, but for your digital chores. It's like having a little helper living inside your computer (minus the creepy part).


## Installation

Simply download stand_tools.bat and follow the menu.


## Requirements

- A computer (obviously).
- Basic understanding of how to click and type.
- A sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended).

## Disclaimer
This script comes with a "no judgment" policy. Whether you trust it with admin privileges or not, we promise it won't hold a grudge.

## Contributions
Got an idea to make this even better? Fork it, tweak it, and send a pull request.
